# Dynamic Runtime Repo Indexing Implementation

## Overview
Implemented dynamic runtime repository indexing for the MIM package manager in LonxOS, eliminating the need to redeploy or rebuild the OS when adding new repositories.

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced Repository Management (`mim.ts` and `mim.js`)

#### New Data Structures:
- **In-memory cache**: `Map<string, RepoIndex>` for fast repository access
- **RepoIndex interface**: Stores packages, last fetched timestamp, and URL
- **Package interface**: Enhanced with better type definitions

#### New Core Functions:
- `generateRepoId(url)`: Creates unique hash-based IDs for cache files
- `getCachedRepo(url)`: Retrieves repo data from memory or filesystem cache
- `setCachedRepo(url, packages)`: Stores repo data in both memory and disk
- `fetchAndIndexRepo(url)`: Fetches and validates repository data
- `getAllPackages()`: Aggregates packages from all cached repositories

### 2. Improved Package Installation Flow

#### Before:
```bash
mim install pkg → fetch all repos → search → install
```

#### After:
```bash
mim install pkg → search cached repos → install (much faster!)
```

The new `installPackage()` function:
1. Searches all cached repository data instantly
2. Shows which repo contains the package
3. Downloads and installs with metadata tracking

### 3. New Commands Added

| Command | Description | Example |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| `mim search <term>` | Live search through all repo packages | `mim search editor` |
| `mim refresh` | Force re-index all repositories | `mim refresh` |
| `mim repo-info [url]` | Show repository information and status | `mim repo-info` |
| `mim verify` | Check repository connectivity | `mim verify` |
| `mim help` | Show comprehensive help | `mim help` |

### 4. Enhanced `addrepo` Command

#### Before:
```bash
mim addrepo <url>  # Just adds URL to list
```

#### After:
```bash
mim addrepo <url>  # Fetches, validates, and caches immediately
✔ Repo added and indexed: 7 packages available.
```

The enhanced `addRepo()` function:
- Immediately fetches the `index.json`
- Validates package structure
- Caches data locally
- Only adds to sources list if successful
- Shows package count confirmation

### 5. Directory Structure for Caching

```
/etc/mim/
├── sources.list              # List of repository URLs
└── cache/
    ├── <hash1>.json         # Cached repo index
    ├── <hash2>.json         # Cached repo index
    └── ...

/var/lib/mim/
└── installed/
    ├── package1.json        # Installation metadata
    ├── package2.json        # Installation metadata
    └── ...
```

### 6. Boot Integration

#### Added to `kernel.ts` and `kernel.js`:
- Import `initMim` function
- Call during boot process after filesystem initialization
- Graceful error handling if initialization fails

#### The `initMim()` function:
- Loads cached repositories on boot
- Auto-refreshes if no cached data found
- Runs silently in background

### 7. Updated Documentation

#### Enhanced man page (`repo/packages/man.js`):
- Updated command descriptions
- Added new commands with examples
- Documented caching behavior
- Listed new filesystem locations

## Workflow Examples

### Adding a New Repository:
```bash
$ mim addrepo https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/user/repo/index.json
[mim] Fetching repo index from https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/user/repo/index.json...
✔ Repo added and indexed: 12 packages available.
```

### Installing a Package:
```bash
$ mim install coolpackage
[mim] Searching for package: coolpackage...
[mim] Found coolpackage v1.2.3 in repo: https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/user/repo/index.json
[mim] Downloading coolpackage...
[mim] Installed: coolpackage v1.2.3
```

### Searching for Packages:
```bash
$ mim search editor
[mim] Searching for packages matching: editor
[mim] Found 3 package(s):
  nano v2.5.3 - A simple text editor
  vim v8.2.0 - Advanced text editor
  micro v2.0.8 - Modern terminal-based editor
```

## Technical Benefits

1. **Real-time availability**: Packages are installable immediately after adding a repo
2. **Offline capability**: Cached repository data works without internet
3. **Performance**: In-memory caching makes package searches extremely fast
4. **Reliability**: Validation prevents broken repositories from being added
5. **User experience**: Clear feedback and status messages throughout operations

## Backward Compatibility

All existing MIM commands continue to work as before, with enhanced functionality:
- `mim sources` now shows repository status and package counts
- `mim list` works unchanged
- `mim install` and `mim remove` work faster due to caching

The implementation maintains full compatibility with existing repository formats and configurations.
