# Filesystem Module

The filesystem module in Lonx OS is responsible for managing files and directories on storage devices. This document provides an overview of the virtual filesystem, persistence, and mounting in Lonx OS.

## Virtual Filesystem

Lonx OS uses a virtual filesystem (VFS) to provide a unified interface for accessing different types of filesystems. The VFS abstracts the underlying filesystem implementation, allowing applications to work with files and directories in a consistent manner, regardless of the actual filesystem being used.

## Persistence

Persistence in Lonx OS is achieved through the use of storage devices, such as hard drives, solid-state drives, and USB drives. The filesystem module is responsible for reading from and writing to these devices, ensuring that data is stored and retrieved correctly.

## Mounting

Mounting is the process of making a filesystem accessible at a specific point in the directory tree. In Lonx OS, you can mount various filesystems, including:

*   **Local Filesystems**: Filesystems located on local storage devices.
*   **Network Filesystems**: Filesystems located on remote servers, accessible over a network.
*   **Virtual Filesystems**: Special filesystems that do not correspond to any physical device, such as `/proc` and `/sys`.

The `mount` command is used to mount filesystems in Lonx OS. For more information on how to use the `mount` command, refer to the Lonx OS user guide.

## Customization

The filesystem module can be extended to support new filesystem types. To add support for a new filesystem, you need to implement a driver that conforms to the VFS interface. For more information on how to develop a filesystem driver, refer to the Lonx OS developer documentation.
