# Networking Module

The networking module in Lonx OS is responsible for managing network connections and providing network services. This document provides an overview of the networking core, the `fetch` command, the adt protocol, and the proxy server in Lonx OS.

## Networking Core

The networking core is the central component of the networking module. It is responsible for:

*   **Managing Network Interfaces**: The networking core detects and configures network interfaces, such as Ethernet and Wi-Fi adapters.
*   **Handling Network Protocols**: The networking core implements various network protocols, such as TCP/IP, UDP, and DNS.
*   **Providing a Socket API**: The networking core provides a socket API that allows applications to create and use network sockets for communication.

## `fetch` Command

The `fetch` command is a command-line utility that allows you to download files from the internet. It supports various protocols, including HTTP, HTTPS, and FTP. The `fetch` command is a convenient way to download files without having to open a web browser.

## ADT Protocol

The ADT (Advanced Data Transfer) protocol is a custom protocol developed for Lonx OS. It is designed to provide a fast and reliable way to transfer large amounts of data over a network. The ADT protocol is used by various system components, such as the package manager and the system update utility.

## Proxy Server

Lonx OS includes a built-in proxy server that can be used to route network traffic through a central point. The proxy server can be configured to:

*   **Cache frequently accessed content**: This can improve performance and reduce bandwidth usage.
*   **Filter content**: This can be used to block access to certain websites or to remove ads and other unwanted content.
*   **Provide anonymity**: This can be used to hide your IP address and protect your privacy online.

For more information on how to configure and use the proxy server, refer to the Lonx OS user guide.
